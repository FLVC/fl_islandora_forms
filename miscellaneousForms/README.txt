2017Fall-FAUdoiCleanUpFormVersion2

Installed on FAU's site in Fall 2017.
This form opens any identifiers, and opens the location URL field.  FAU had previously stored DOIs as location URL.  This let FAU look at the location URL values, and use those to find DOIs, then copy paste any DOIs into the DOI field.

Clean up form version 2 is preferred.  The version one form was only deployed for a short period.
