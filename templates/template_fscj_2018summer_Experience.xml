  <note>The Experience, the Art and Literature Magazine of Florida State College at Jacksonville, is published annually in the spring.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
The Experience is the College’s second art and literature magazine. It was preceded by a magazine called Reason, 
which only published one issue in 1967 and did not continue. That explains why ours start with “volume 2” even though it 
is actually volume 1.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
“The experience of all humanity lies either lost within the minds of men or preserved upon the printed page. Each of us experiences those 
favors of life within our grasp; and yet, some few have realized uncommon endeavor. For these, the quest is not only personal 
gratification, but also an attempt to preserve and reflect each sensation, so that man might not miss the slightest opportunity for 
shared experience. And to these few belongs the glory of experience that outshines even Ulysses’s greatest deeds.”--Editor, Vol. 2&lt;br/&gt;
