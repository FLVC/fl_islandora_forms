In Summer 2016, it was discovered that the Full MODS form cannot be used to make edits to a MODS record when that MODS record has a <dateIssued> with both a start point and an end point.

The problem had been introduced in Nov. 2015 with the form update then.  (Gail was able to look back at server logs and see the same error occurring very rarely since then.)

The Nov. 2015 form update changed the way date encoding is handled, and also corrected many typos in the form.

This form reverts the changes to the way date encoding is handled, but keeps the other corrections.
It also adds in institution codes for two new sites that have come on board since then:  St. Petersburg College, and Valencia College.

As of Sept. 15, 2016, this form has been tested and is ready to go out to production sites.  - Wilhelmina
